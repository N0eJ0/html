for - specifies which id this label belongs to

type - type of input
id - unique id for the label to identify the input
<input> name - in certain scenarios a group of elements belong to the same input group. ex: if there's 4 options in a radio input none of the other three should be selected when one of the options is selected and for html to understand which elements belong in the same group name tag is used to show all of them belongs to same group. also it helps server to identify which group each element belongs to

placeholder* - default text that should appear inside the text dialogue box
autocomplete - suggests previously given inputs
required - highlights the text dialogue box, blocks the user from submitting an empty input
autofocus - to make the cursor appear inside the text dialogue box immediately after opening the site

the above two input forms will be placed next to each other instead of in different lines, to make the input forms on different lines use <div> or <p>

type="password" - to hide the texts inside the input form

pattern - enforces a regular expresson
example: pattern="[0-9]{4}[0-9]{6}" //we can give the follwoing number as an input 0484 2621234

step - increment by the multiple of the value specified in step

value - gives the form a default value, might send that value to server?

<select> - used to include multiple options to be selected by the user

<select> multiple - to choose multiple options

<select> size - to specify how many options should be shown on screen at a time

<options> - each unique element of the select tag is given in options tag

<options> selected - displays that specific option as the default value in the input form

<options> required - force the user to complete input forms that were left blank when user try to submit

<fieldset>
